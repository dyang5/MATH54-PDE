# Swarthmore College, MATH 054: Partial Differential Equations, Spring 2023.

This repo contains a collection of my homework material, final project material, and a somewhat-updated collection of typos in the Third Edition of J. David Logan's *Applied Differential Equations*. 

All homework material is my own and I take full responsibility for any typos or incorrect proofs. Feel free to contact me if you see any. On another note, any direct copying of my work is plagarism and should not be done. 

Feel free to contact me for any questions or concerns at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dyang5 -- at -- swarthmore.edu</code>.
